# pymaceuticals-challenge

Background: You've just joined Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

As a senior data analyst at the company, you've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

The code generates tables and figures needed for a technical report on the clinical study that includes a top-level summary of the study results.

A repository labeled pymaceuticals-challenge contains the following files:
*	Data folder with Mouse_metadata and Study_results csvs
*	Jupyter Notebook file labeled Pymaceuticals_Final, which includes an analysis summary

Jupyter Notebook is used to ingest two csv.files from the data folder with follow-on code, which prepares the data, generates summary statistics, creates bar and pie charts, calculates quartiles, finds outliers, creates a line chart, box plot, and scatter plot, then calculates correlation and regression.  

Resources used for this project include, Instructor provided starter code, Office hours, Tutor assistance, Study-Group assistance, course material, pandas.pydata.org and Stack Overflow.
